## Project Overview:
The quiz game is an interactive, web-based application designed to challenge users with multiple-choice questions. It will provide a quiz format similar to popular TV quiz shows, where users answer questions progressively to win virtual money. The game will feature dynamic question loading, a visual representation of progress, and voice control integration for user answers.

## Development Plan:

### **Phase 1: Setup and Initial Development**
- **Task 1: Set up React Project**
  - Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
  - Install necessary libraries: `react-router-dom` (for navigation), `react-speech-recognition` (for voice commands).
  
- **Task 2: Design Layout and UI Components**
  - **Quiz Container**: Create a main container to hold the quiz game.
  - **QuestionCard Component**: Displays the current question and possible answers.
  - **Ladder Component**: A progress bar or ladder displaying the user’s current winnings.
  - **Result Screen**: A component that displays the total winnings after the game finishes.

### **Phase 2: Question Fetching and Display**
- **Task 3: Fetch Questions from API**
  - Use the Open Trivia Database API to fetch a set of 10-15 multiple-choice questions.
  - Decode HTML entities in the fetched questions (to display special characters correctly).

- **Task 4: Display Questions**
  - Map the fetched questions into an array.
  - Display the current question and its options in the `QuestionCard` component.
  - Implement the logic to move between questions after an answer is selected.

### **Phase 3: Progress and Feedback**
- **Task 5: Add Progress Tracker (Ladder)**
  - Display the current question number and corresponding prize money.
  - Track the user’s progress on the ladder based on their correct answers.

- **Task 6: Feedback System**
  - Provide immediate feedback after each answer (correct or incorrect).
  - Display a message (e.g., "Congratulations! That's correct.") or "Sorry, the correct answer was...".

### **Phase 4: Implement Speech Recognition**
- **Task 7: Add Voice Recognition Integration**
  - Implement speech recognition using the `SpeechRecognition` API.
  - Start voice recognition when the game begins.
  - Capture user’s voice input and match it to the answers.
  - If the spoken answer matches one of the options, proceed with the answer selection logic.

### **Phase 5: Game Logic**
- **Task 8: Handle Correct and Incorrect Answers**
  - If the user answers correctly, move to the next question and update winnings.
  - If the user answers incorrectly, end the game and display the result screen with their total winnings.

- **Task 9: Timer or Delay between Answers**
  - Add a brief delay after each answer is submitted to show the result message before moving to the next question.
  
### **Phase 6: End Game**
- **Task 10: Show Results**
  - At the end of the game (either by answering all questions or quitting early), show a result screen with total winnings.
  - Add an option to restart the game or return to the homepage.

## Possible Features for Future Updates:
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple players to compete against each other in real-time.
- **Leaderboard**: Display high scores or top players.
- **Custom Quizzes**: Let users create their own quizzes with custom questions.
- **Timer**: Introduce a countdown timer for answering questions.
- **Achievements**: Reward users with achievements or badges for milestones (e.g., answering all questions correctly).

## Conclusion:
The quiz game provides a fun and interactive experience for users while integrating modern web technologies like speech recognition. The detailed plan above covers the development phases, tasks, and additional features for building a smooth and engaging quiz game. With an emphasis on both voice-controlled interaction and traditional gameplay, this quiz game will cater to a diverse user base, making trivia fun and accessible.
